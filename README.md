# 3D Interactive Visualization of Vibration Simulation

Minimizing engine noise presents an important task when designing an engine, so
it is of utmost importance to keep the engine vibration strength at the lowest possible
level since it directly affects the noise level produced by the engine. NVH (Noise,
Vibration, Harshness) simulations provide an easy way to check the vibration strength
of individual engine parts at the design stage. However, computational simulations of
this kind often produce data that is hard to analyze, so visualization tools help significantly
by presenting the calculated data intuitively and understandably. This thesis
describes the development of an application for visualizing data obtained from NVH
simulation using a 3D engine model and 2D graphs. The focus of the presented tool
is to enable a simpler way of comparing the vibration of engine parts with respect to
selected frequencies.

This is a GitHub project of my master thesis on the same name for the tool I developed using C++ and OpenGL.
