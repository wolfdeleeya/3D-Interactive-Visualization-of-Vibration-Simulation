abstract = {A methodology for visualizing analytic and synthetic geometry in RN is presented. It is based on a system of parallel coordinates which induces a non-projective mapping between N-Dimensional and 2-Dimensional sets. Hypersurfaces are represented by their planar images which have some geometrical properties analogous to the properties of the hypersurface that they represent. A point ← → line duality when N = 2 generalizes to lines and hyperplanes enabling the representation of polyhedra in RN. The representation of a class of convex and non-convex hypersurfaces is discussed together with an algorithm for constructing and displaying any interior point. The display shows some local properties of the hypersurface and provides information on the point's proximity to the boundary. Applications to Air Traffic Control, Robotics, Computer Vision, Computational Geometry, Statistics, Instrumentation and other areas are discussed.},

abstract = {We present a nested model for the visualization design process withfour layers: characterize the problem domain, abstract into operationson data types, design visual encoding and interaction techniques, andcreate algorithms to execute techniques efficiently. The output from alevel above is input to the level below, bringing attention to thedesign challenge that an upstream error inevitably cascades to alldownstream levels. This model provides prescriptive guidance fordetermining appropriate evaluation approaches by identifying threatsto validity unique to each level. We call attention to specific stepsin the design and evaluation process that are often given shortshrift. We also provide three recommendations motivated by this model:authors should distinguish between these levels when claimingcontributions at more than one of them, authors should explicitlystate upstream assumptions at levels above the focus of a paper, andvisualization venues should accept more papers on domaincharacterization.},
